## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [x] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** The doctype is the required first line <!DOCTYPE html> of an HTML document. 
  - **Use:** This line ensures that browsers will use full-standards mode when rendering the page. 
  - **Example:** Before the development of the W3C web standards, HTML documents were written in different versions for different browsers. The doctype ensures that your document will be parsed the same way by all browsers, according to the HTML5 web standards.

    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-doctype-declaration-in-html/
- [x] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** You can serve a page with content in multiple languages by setting the lang attribute on any tags on the page. 
  - **Use:**  First, you set the lang attribute on the root/html tag with the default language of the content, so that it is inherited by the child elements. Then for any elements in a different language, set their lang attribute to that language. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you had a page of English text with a few quotes in French, you would set `<html lang="en">` and then `<q lang="fr">` on the quotes.
  - **Source:** https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-language-declarations
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when DESIGNING for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** Some issues you must be aware of when designing for multilingual sites include the inaccuracy of machine translations, the need to adjust content and assets for cultural sensitivity, and the need to organize content in a way that is intuitive for speakers of other languages. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you're designing a page in Arabic, which is written right to left, you'll want to arrange the navigation and menu options in reverse order from a typical page in English. You may also need to avoid images of women with loose hair and exposed skin, as this could be offensive to an Arabic audience.   
  - **Source:** https://www.popwebdesign.net/popart_blog/en/2018/01/multilingual-website-design-mistakes/
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when DEVELOPING for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** Some issues you must be aware of when developing for multilingual sites include:
    - using the lang attribute in your HTML (though you should always do this anyway) 
    - having menu options that allow the user to change the language of the page
    - avoiding placing text in raster-based images (e.g. png, jpg, gif), as each language will need a separate image
    - designing layouts and components that won't break if the translated text is much longer
    - being aware of differing perceptions of color
    - formatting currency and dates differently
    - not concatenating translated strings, as the word order may be different
    - organizing content with the language reading direction in mind             
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions
- [x] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** Data attributes are used on elements to store custom data which relates to that application and for which there is no standard attribute. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you wanted to sort a list of music tracks by length, you could add `data-length="#"` to each track. 
  - **Use:** Data attributes are also useful as hooks for end-to-end testing frameworks such as Selenium.

    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes
- [X] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:** HTML5 is the newest version of the free and open source technologies on which the web is based, including HTML and web APIs. 
  - **Use:** The building blocks or new features of HTML5 include:
    - semantics - new elements to more precisely describe content (ex: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`)  
    - offline and client-side storage (ex: local storage and session storage)
    - native audio and video support ()
    - native support for dynamic 2D/3D graphics through the `<canvas>` element
    - access to new input and output devices (ex: cameras, microphones, screen sharing)
    - better performance and hardware integration
    - connectivity - new ways to communicate with the server
    - more sophisticated styling
  - **Example:**

- [X] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** Cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage are all ways to store string data on the client side. However, cookies are sent back to the server with each subsequent HTTP request, whereas sessionStorage and localStorage are not. 
  - **Use/Example:** Cookies are typically used for remembering stateful information, such as whether two requests came from the same browser. For example, cookies might be used to remember a user's shopping cart contents, set user preferences, or track user behavior.
  - **Use/Explanation:** Local storage differs from session storage in that localStorage persists across browser sessions, but sessionStorage is cleared once the user closes that tab. 
  - **Use/Example:** A use case for sessionStorage would be to autosave user inputs to a form if the page is refreshed, while localStorage might be used for saving the scores for a simple game, like Wordle.

    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_stateless_but_not_sessionless 
- [X] Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:** When execution reaches a plain `<script>` tag, the browser stops parsing the HTML, fetches the script file, and executes it before it resumes parsing the HTML. This causes two problems: 1) the script can't access any DOM elements that have not been parsed yet, and 2) the user can't see the rest of the page content until the script is finished. 
  - **Use:** `<script defer>` and `<script async>` are solutions to these problems. `<script defer>` downloads the scripts in the background and then executes the scripts in document order once the HTML document has been loaded and parsed. `<script async>` downloads the scripts in the background and then pauses the HTML to execute each script as it finishes loading. 
  - **Example:** `<script defer>` should be used for scripts which need the whole DOM or are dependent on each other, where `<script async>` should be used for completely independent scripts, like ads or Google Analytics.  
  - **Source:** 
    - https://javascript.info/script-async-defer
    - https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html#script 
- [X] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:** Placing CSS `<link>`s in the `<head>` allows the page to render progressively, which improves user experience. If `<link>`s are placed at the bottom of the document, some browsers block rendering so that elements do not need to be repainted if their styles change. Users will be stuck looking at a blank page or seeing flashes of unstyled content. The W3C standards specify that CSS `<link>`s should be placed in the `<head>`. 
  - **Example (Exception):** Two exceptions are HTML email, which uses inline styles, as it does not have access to external stylesheets, and critical path CSS, where the styles needed for generating the content above the fold are put directly into a `<style>` tag in the head. 
  - **Explanation:** Placing JS `<script>`s just before the closing `</body>` tag is a often good idea because it allows the browser to display the page content to the user first, without waiting for the `<script>` to load and execute. It also allows the script to access DOM elements without throwing an error.
  - **Example (Exception):** A downside to this approach is that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. A solution is to place the scripts in the <head> with the defer attribute.

- [X] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:** Progressive rendering refers to rendering the most critical content on the page first, and then rendering the non-critical content in stages, as needed by the user. 
  - **Use:** Progressive rendering is used to reduce the perceived load time of the page. 
  - **Example:** Techniques for progressive rendering include lazy loading of images (i.e. images do not load until the user scrolls to them), prioritizing "above the fold" content, and rendering critical content on the server and streaming it in chunks to the browser.

- [x] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:** The srcset attribute allows you to specify multiple image files that the browser can choose from when displaying that image. 
  - **Use:** You would use this attribute when you need to display the same image in different sizes, depending on the size and resolution of the screen.
  - **Example:** When evaluating this attribute, the browser divides the width of each image by the screen's width to determines which image is the best size for the current screen.

    - https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/
- [x] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - **Explanation:** I've used primarily EJS in my fullstack applications to generate HTML dynamically.  
  - **Use:** At my previous job, I also used templated HTML in Google Apps Script, to build a spreadsheet add-on for managing student recommendations. 
  - **Example:** I love EJS for its simple syntax, but I've found that most HTML templating languages provide similar functionality.  
  - **Source:**

### CSS

- [x] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** CSS selector specificity is how the browser determines which styles to apply to an element. 
  - **Use:** The specificity weight of a declaration is determined by the number of selectors of each weight category: id selectors, class selectors, and tag selectors. Id selectors have the highest weight, while tag selectors have the lowest weight. 
  - **Example:** For example, the selector .main #hero-image would have a specificity of 1.1.0. 
  - **Explanation:** The browser calculates the specificity for each declaration that matches the element, and the declaration with the highest specificity is applied, or in case of a tie, the declaration that comes last in the stylesheet. 
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
- [x] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:** A CSS reset clears out all of the browser's default styling so that you can start from scratch. A "normalizing" stylesheet changes the default styles of different browsers to match each other. 
  - **Use:** Both of these solutions are used to make styles appear consisent across browsers. 
  - **Example:** I generally prefer to use the "normalizing" approach, to take advantage of some useful default styling, speed development, and keep my file size smaller. 
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** Float is a CSS positioning property that moves an element to the right or left and allows other elements to flow around it. 
  - **Use:** They were often used to make flexible column layouts, as well as to make text wrap naturally around an image. 
  - **Example:** Floats come with several problems. For instance, a parent element will collapse to zero height if it contains only floated elements, and elements around the float can also be affected by it. Flexbox and grid are better tools for creating flexible layouts. 
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/#describe-floats-and-how-they-work
- [x] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:** Z-index controls the vertical stacking order of overlapping elements. 
  - **Use:** By default, elements stack vertically in the order they appear in the DOM, but the z-index property allows us to change this behavior. 
  - **Example:** Stacking contexts are created by the root <html> element, when an element is positioned and given a z-index value other than auto, or when an element has an opacity of less than 1. Stacking contexts create a separate layer. The children inside each stacking context are ordered relative to their parent, before that layer is in turn arranged relative to any outer stacking contexts. 
  - **Source:** 
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
     - https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/#describe-z-index-and-how-stacking-context-is-formed

- [x] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:** In the CSS rendering of a page, Block Formatting Context is a region in which blocks are laid out. New BFCs are created by floats, fixed or absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks, table-cells, elements with overflow other than visible, and elements with display: flow-root.  
  - **Use:** A BFC is like a mini-layout inside your page, and it's important because contains any floats inside it and prevents margin-collapsing. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you needed to contain a floated box inside a parent container, you could eatablish a new BFC by setting display: flow-root on the container. 
  - **Source:** https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/understanding-css-layout-block-formatting-context/
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context 
- [x] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:** One technique for clearing floats is the .clearfix hack. 
  - **Use:** The .clearfix hack works by inserting an element with no content just inside the closing tag of the parent container so that it can't collapse, and setting clear: both on this element.   
  
```css  
        .clearfix:after {
            content: "";
            display: table;
            clear: both;
        }
```
  - **Explanation:** Another technique is establishing a new block formatting context by setting overflow: auto or display: flow-root on the parent container. 
  - **Example:** I would go with .clearfix or display: flow-root in most contexts, as setting overflow: auto can lead to unintended scrollbars.
  - **Source:** https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/
  
- [x] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** CSS sprites are a way of combining multiple images into one image file, and then using the background-image and -position properties to display a part of the image each time. 
  - **Use:** They are used to increase performance, since you only need to download one image, rather than multiple images. 
  - **Example:** Image sprites are a great technique for small icons or a graphical text-editor menu. 
  - **Source:** https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/
- [x] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:** There are a number of approaches to this issue, such as serving browser-specific stylesheets and using a library like Bootstrap. I always start by using Normalize.css or Reset.css, to make styling consistent across browsers. I also research the feature support for the browsers I am using and implement vendor prefixes, fallback properties, and polyfills to take care of any browser-specific issues.
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#how-would-you-approach-fixing-browser-specific-styling-issues
- [x] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:** I prefer to plan for feature-constrained browsers from the beginning by building lightweight, simple sites using progressive enhancement. 
  - **Use:** If you focus on building the base HTML and CSS with semantics and accessibility in mind, you'll get a site that works well in feature-constrained browsers. I then layer on additional CSS and client-side JavaScript judiciously and use vendor prefixes, fallbacks, and polyfills to add support for newer features in older browsers as needed. 
  - **Example:** I also use CSS @support feature query rules to apply certain styles only if the browser supports them.

- [x] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:** There are several ways to hide content visually but keep it accessible for screen readers. For instance, you can position it absolutely off screen (`left: -1000px; top: -1000px;`), set its height and width to 0, or use the clip-path or text-indent properties.
  - **Use:** I prefer to define a "visually hidden" class that combines all of the various solutions, to make sure that it works in all browsers. 
  - **Example:**
  
```css
  .visually-hidden {
      position: absolute;
      width: 1px;
      height: 1px;
      padding: 0;
      margin: -1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      clip-path: inset(0, 0);
      white-space: nowrap; /* added line */
      border: 0;
  }
  
```

- [x] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I have created grid layouts with floats, flexbox, and CSS grid. 
  - **Use:** I like to use flexbox for building smaller components, which can in turn be positioned on the page using CSS grid. I prefer using grid for the overall layout of the page, since it allows you to more precisely place elements along both axes. 
  - **Example:** Grid also allows you to easily create very different layouts for different breakpoints. 
- [x] Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I use media queries and mobile-specific layouts on every site I build, to make my pages responsive. 
  - **Use:** I typically design for mobile first, locate the breakpoints, and use media queries to convert the layout from mobile to desktop. 
  - **Example:** For example, I often move the navigation bar inside a hamburger menu below a certain breakpoint, or change the flex-direction of a card container from row on desktop to column on mobile. 
- [x] Are you familiar with styling SVG?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I am. SVGs can be styled by adding attributes to a node, using inline CSS, embedding a CSS section in a <style> tag in the definitions section, or linking external CSS files.
  - **Use:** I have edited logos and icons by using the `fill` and `stroke` attributes to change colors. 
  - **Example:** <rect width="100" height="100" stroke="blue" fill="purple" />
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes  
- [x] Can you give an example of an `@media` property other than screen?
  - **Explanation:** In media queries, there are properties for media types and media features. 
  - **Use:** The three media types are all, screen, and print (others are deprecated). Some media features include min-width and max-width, aspect-ratio, resolution, orientation, color, grid, and bitmap.
  - **Example:** For example, you could write a query `@media screen and (max-width: 390px)` to target screen devices under 391px wide.

- [x] What are some of the "gotchas" for writing efficient CSS?
  - **Explanation:** It's important to keep in mind that browsers parse selectors from right to left, so they first find all the elements that match the key selector, and then parse the prequalifiers.
  - **Use:**  You want to avoid using long relationship selectors and key selectors that match many elements, like tag and universal selectors. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can render the styles. 
  - **Example:** For example, using a single class like `.hero_image` is a better choice than `.hero img`. 
  - You also want to be aware of properties that trigger reflow, repaint, or compositing, and avoid writing styles that change the layout.

- [x] What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?
  - **Explanation:** CSS preprocessors have a lot of useful features, like the ability to use variables, math operations, and mixins (to define reusable styles), as well as the ability to organize styles into multiple files and combine them later. 
  - **Use:** These features can make CSS faster to write and easier to maintain and organize. 
  - **Example:** For example, by using variables, you can change a color in one place instead of having to change it everywhere. 
  - **Explanation: ** One disadvantage is that debugging is harder, because the line numbers of the generated CSS don't correspond to the line numbers of our preprocessed CSS. Second, preprocessors can generate huge CSS files. Finally, the compilation step slows development (since you have to wait for it to finish in order to see your changes).

- [x] How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?
  - **Note:** web design comp = web design comprehensive = a mock-up 
  - **Explanation:** I would implement non-standard fonts by using the `@font-face` CSS rule and defining the weights needed for that font. 
  - **Use:** This approach will load the font from the server if the user does not have it installed on their computer. I would also be sure to define font fallbacks in the `font-family` property, in case for some reason the font files were blocked from downloading.
  - **Example:** You can also implement some non-standard fonts by linking a Google font stylesheet in the head of your HTML.

  - **Explanation:** The broswer parses a CSS selector from right to left. It first finds all the elements that match the key selector. Then for the prequalifiesr, it traverses up it the elements' parents in the DOM to determine which elements match. 
  - **Example:** For example with the selector `p span`, browsers first find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up their parents all the way up to the root to find any `<p>` elements. For a particular `<span>`, as soon as it finds a `<p>`, it knows that the `<span>` matches and can stop its matching.
  - **Use:** This is why it is so important to use short selector chains and avoid key selectors that match many elements (like tags and *).

- [x] Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.
  - **Explanation:** Pseudo-elements are keywords added to a CSS selector that let you style a particular part of the selector or add content that is not in the HTML. 
  - **Use:** They include `:first-letter`, `first-line`, `::before` and `::after`.  
  - **Example:** For example, if you wanted to make the first letter in each paragraph larger, you could use `p:first-letter`. If you wanted to add decorative icons without cluttering the document tree with unsemantic elements, you could use `::before` to insert them.

- [x] Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser, through CSS, to render your layout in different box models.
  - **Explanation:** In the box model, every element on the page is represented as a rectangular box of content, with optional padding, border, and margin. The box model is responsible for calculating the dimensions of each box and whether or not their padding or margin will overlap or collapse. 
  - **Use:** In the default content-box setting, the browser calculates a box's size by taking its specified height/width and adding any padding and border to get its total size. 
  - **Example:** So for example, if an element's width is set at 100px, but it has a left padding and right padding of 20px each, the box's total width would be 140px. 
  -**Explanation:** To use the more intuitive border-box model, you would set `{box-sizing: border box}` on the universal selector (and any before/after pseudo elements). This allows you to specify the total dimensions of a box, including any padding or border, with the `height` and `width` properties. So in the previous example, if the total width of the element is set at 100px and it has a left and right padding of 20px each, the content would be only 60px wide, to account for the 40px of padding. 
  - **Source:** https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/#understand-the-css-box-model
- [x] What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?
  - **Explanation:** Setting `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` allows you to specify the total dimensions of a box, including any padding or border, with the `height` and `width` properties.  
  - **Use:** This allows you to set actual sizes and avoid having to do any math to take padding and borders into account.
  - **Example:** So for example, if the total width of the element is set at 100px and it has a left and right padding of 20px each, the content would be only 60px wide, to account for the 40px of padding.

- [x] What is the CSS `display` property and can you give a few examples of its use?
  - **Explanation/Use:** The `display` property defines whether an element is treated as a block or inline element in the flow layout of the page, and also the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.
  - **Example:** For example, if you set `display: block`, you're setting the outer display value; the next element will start on a new line, so that the boxes are laid out vertically. If you set `display: flex` you're setting the inner display value, so the element's children will be laid out as flex items within that container. You can also set values like `display: none`, which renders the page without the element, or combo values like `display: inline-flex`, which treats the element itself as an inline element in the flow layout, but lays its children out as flex items. 
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display
- [x] What's the difference between `inline` and `inline-block`?
  - **Explanation:** Inline elements are laid out horizontally on the same line, and wrap to a new line when they run out of space. They can have horizontal padding and margin, but cannot be given explicit width, height, or vertical margin. 
  - **Use:** Inline-block elements are still laid out horizontally on the same line, but can take on all box model properties, like block elements can (including width, height, and vertical margin).
  - **Example:** A good use case for inline-block elements could be links in a navigation menu, so that they can be arranged horizontally, but can be given consistent dimensions (rather than defaulting to the width of the link text). 
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow
- [x] What's the difference between a `relative`, `fixed`, `absolute` and `static` positioned element?
  - **Static** is the default value for the `position` property, and it means that the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
  - **Relative** behaves the same way as static, unless you combine it with box-model offsets, like `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, which shift the element relative to its default position. For example, `position: relative `and `left: 20px` shift the element 20px to the left of its normal position. Other elements will not fill the space it would otherwise have occupied, but they may overlap at its new position. 
  - **Absolutely** positioned elements are removed from the document flow and no space is left for them in the page layout. The box offset properties position the element relative to its nearest positioned parent (or the body).  
  - **Fixed** also works in conjunction with the same box offest properties, but the element is positioned relative to the viewport and stays in that position when the screen is scrolled.

- [x] Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I have used both flexbox and grid, and both have their advantages for different situations. 
  - **Use:** Flexbox solves many traditional CSS problems, like vertical centering of elements within a container. It's is primarily meant for layouts in one direction, while grid is meant for laying out content in both directions.
  - **Example:**  I often use flexbox to build smaller components or sections, and then use grid to arrange those components on the page. I love how grid allows you to create very different layouts at different breakpoints by using `grid-template-areas`.

- [x] Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?
  - **Explanation:** A responsive website is coded to dynamically adapt its content and layout based on different screen sizes, orientations, and devices. A mobile-first strategy is also responsive, but all styles are defined for the mobile breakpoint first, and then additional styles are defined for larger screens. 
  - **Use:** Using a mobile-first strategy for responsive design can ensure that mobile users have a seamless and optimized experience. 
  - **Example:** For example, mobile-first sites perform better on mobile devices with limited bandwidth, since their styles don't have to be checked against media queries before being applied.

- [x] How is responsive design different from adaptive design?
  - **Explanation:** In a responsive site, the design changes fluidly and continually based on the size of the browser at any point, whereas in an adaptive site, the design changes at specific breakpoints or on specific devices. 
  - **Use:** Both strategies are used to optimize a website's content and layout for different screens. 
  - **Example:** One way to think about the difference is smooth vs. snap design. For example, as the browser width increases, a responsive container smoothly expands. An adaptive container, however, might start at one size and then snap to another size once the browser width is above 500px.

- [x] Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?
  - **Explanation:** Retina is a marketing term coined by Apple to describe screens with high enough pixel density that the human eye can't pick out individual pixels. In order to keep images looking crisp on high resolution screens, we need to use high resolution graphics whenever possible, while also minimizing page load times.
  - **Use:** One technique I use to overcome this issue is serving responsive images using the HTML5 `srcset` attribute.  
  - **Example:** This allows us to provide a set of image options at different sizes and let the browser calculate the best image for the screen size and resolution.  
  
   ```
  <img
  src="/images/test-1600.jpg"
  srcset="
    /images/test-400.jpg   400w,
    /images/test-800.jpg   800w,
    /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w
  "/>
  ```

- [x] Is there any reason you'd want to use `translate()` instead of `absolute` positioning, or vice-versa? And why?
  - **Use:** `transform: translate()` is a much better choice for animations than `absolute` positioning. 
  - **Explanation:** `absolute' positioning changes the layout, so it triggers reflow, paint, and compositing. `translate()` on the other hand only triggers compositing, so it is much more efficient and results in smoother animations. 
  - **Example:** When using `translate()`, the element's original space on the page is still preserved (sort of like `position: relative`), so you might want to use `absolute` positioning if that's not the desired behavior.

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
