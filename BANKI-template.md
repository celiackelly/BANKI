## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [x] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** The doctype is the required first line <!DOCTYPE html> of an HTML document. 
  - **Use:** This line ensures that browsers will use full-standards mode when rendering the page. 
  - **Example:** Before the development of the W3C web standards, HTML documents were written in different versions for different browsers. The doctype ensures that your document will be parsed the same way by all browsers, according to the HTML5 web standards.

    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-doctype-declaration-in-html/
- [x] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** You can serve a page with content in multiple languages by setting the lang attribute on any tags on the page. 
  - **Use:**  First, you set the lang attribute on the root/html tag with the default language of the content, so that it is inherited by the child elements. Then for any elements in a different language, set their lang attribute to that language. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you had a page of English text with a few quotes in French, you would set `<html lang="en">` and then `<q lang="fr">` on the quotes.
  - **Source:** https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-language-declarations
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when DESIGNING for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** Some issues you must be aware of when designing for multilingual sites include the inaccuracy of machine translations, the need to adjust content and assets for cultural sensitivity, and the need to organize content in a way that is intuitive for speakers of other languages. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you're designing a page in Arabic, which is written right to left, you'll want to arrange the navigation and menu options in reverse order from a typical page in English. You may also need to avoid images of women with loose hair and exposed skin, as this could be offensive to an Arabic audience.   
  - **Source:** https://www.popwebdesign.net/popart_blog/en/2018/01/multilingual-website-design-mistakes/
- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when DEVELOPING for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** Some issues you must be aware of when developing for multilingual sites include:
    - using the lang attribute in your HTML (though you should always do this anyway) 
    - having menu options that allow the user to change the language of the page
    - avoiding placing text in raster-based images (e.g. png, jpg, gif), as each language will need a separate image
    - designing layouts and components that won't break if the translated text is much longer
    - being aware of differing perceptions of color
    - formatting currency and dates differently
    - not concatenating translated strings, as the word order may be different
    - organizing content with the language reading direction in mind

- [x] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** Data attributes are used on elements to store custom data which relates to that application and for which there is no standard attribute. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you wanted to sort a list of music tracks by length, you could add `data-length="#"` to each track. 
  - **Use:** Data attributes are also useful as hooks for end-to-end testing frameworks such as Selenium.

- [X] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:** HTML5 is the newest version of the free and open source technologies on which the web is based, including HTML and web APIs. 
  - **Use:** The building blocks or new features of HTML5 include:
    - semantics - new elements to more precisely describe content (ex: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`)  
    - offline and client-side storage (ex: local storage and session storage)
    - native audio and video support ()
    - native support for dynamic 2D/3D graphics through the `<canvas>` element
    - access to new input and output devices (ex: cameras, microphones, screen sharing)
    - better performance and hardware integration
    - connectivity - new ways to communicate with the server
    - more sophisticated styling

- [X] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** Cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage are all ways to store string data on the client side. However, cookies are sent back to the server with each subsequent HTTP request, whereas sessionStorage and localStorage are not. 
  - **Use/Example:** Cookies are typically used for remembering stateful information, such as whether two requests came from the same browser. For example, cookies might be used to remember a user's shopping cart contents, set user preferences, or track user behavior.
  - **Use/Explanation:** Local storage differs from session storage in that localStorage persists across browser sessions, but sessionStorage is cleared once the user closes that tab. 
  - **Use/Example:** A use case for sessionStorage would be to autosave user inputs to a form if the page is refreshed, while localStorage might be used for saving the scores for a simple game, like Wordle.

    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#http_is_stateless_but_not_sessionless 
- [X] Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:** When execution reaches a plain `<script>` tag, the browser stops parsing the HTML, fetches the script file, and executes it before it resumes parsing the HTML. This causes two problems: 1) the script can't access any DOM elements that have not been parsed yet, and 2) the user can't see the rest of the page content until the script is finished. 
  - **Use:** `<script defer>` and `<script async>` are solutions to these problems. `<script defer>` downloads the scripts in the background and then executes the scripts in document order once the HTML document has been loaded and parsed. `<script async>` downloads the scripts in the background and then pauses the HTML to execute each script as it finishes loading. 
  - **Example:** `<script defer>` should be used for scripts which need the whole DOM or are dependent on each other, where `<script async>` should be used for completely independent scripts, like ads or Google Analytics.

    - https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html#script 
- [X] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:** Placing CSS `<link>`s in the `<head>` allows the page to render progressively, which improves user experience. If `<link>`s are placed at the bottom of the document, some browsers block rendering so that elements do not need to be repainted if their styles change. Users will be stuck looking at a blank page or seeing flashes of unstyled content. The W3C standards specify that CSS `<link>`s should be placed in the `<head>`. 
  - **Example (Exception):** Two exceptions are HTML email, which uses inline styles, as it does not have access to external stylesheets, and critical path CSS, where the styles needed for generating the content above the fold are put directly into a `<style>` tag in the head. 
  - **Explanation:** Placing JS `<script>`s just before the closing `</body>` tag is a often good idea because it allows the browser to display the page content to the user first, without waiting for the `<script>` to load and execute. It also allows the script to access DOM elements without throwing an error.
  - **Example (Exception):** A downside to this approach is that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. A solution is to place the scripts in the <head> with the defer attribute.

- [X] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:** Progressive rendering refers to rendering the most critical content on the page first, and then rendering the non-critical content in stages, as needed by the user. 
  - **Use:** Progressive rendering is used to reduce the perceived load time of the page. 
  - **Example:** Techniques for progressive rendering include lazy loading of images (i.e. images do not load until the user scrolls to them), prioritizing "above the fold" content, and rendering critical content on the server and streaming it in chunks to the browser.

- [x] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:** The srcset attribute allows you to specify multiple image files that the browser can choose from when displaying that image. 
  - **Use:** You would use this attribute when you need to display the same image in different sizes, depending on the size and resolution of the screen.
  - **Example:** When evaluating this attribute, the browser divides the width of each image by the screen's width to determines which image is the best size for the current screen.

    - https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/
- [x] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - **Explanation:** I've used primarily EJS in my fullstack applications to generate HTML dynamically.  
  - **Use:** At my previous job, I also used templated HTML in Google Apps Script, to build a spreadsheet add-on for managing student recommendations. 
  - **Example:** I love EJS for its simple syntax, but I've found that most HTML templating languages provide similar functionality.  
  - **Source:**

### CSS

- [x] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** CSS selector specificity is how the browser determines which styles to apply to an element. 
  - **Use:** The specificity weight of a declaration is determined by the number of selectors of each weight category: id selectors, class selectors, and tag selectors. Id selectors have the highest weight, while tag selectors have the lowest weight. 
  - **Example:** For example, the selector .main #hero-image would have a specificity of 1.1.0. 
  - **Explanation:** The browser calculates the specificity for each declaration that matches the element, and the declaration with the highest specificity is applied, or in case of a tie, the declaration that comes last in the stylesheet. 
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
- [x] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:** A CSS reset clears out all of the browser's default styling so that you can start from scratch. A "normalizing" stylesheet changes the default styles of different browsers to match each other. 
  - **Use:** Both of these solutions are used to make styles appear consisent across browsers. 
  - **Example:** I generally prefer to use the "normalizing" approach, to take advantage of some useful default styling, speed development, and keep my file size smaller. 
  - **Source:**
- [x] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** Float is a CSS positioning property that moves an element to the right or left and allows other elements to flow around it. 
  - **Use:** They were often used to make flexible column layouts, as well as to make text wrap naturally around an image. 
  - **Example:** Floats come with several problems. For instance, a parent element will collapse to zero height if it contains only floated elements, and elements around the float can also be affected by it. Flexbox and grid are better tools for creating flexible layouts. 
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions/#describe-floats-and-how-they-work
- [x] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:** Z-index controls the vertical stacking order of overlapping elements. 
  - **Use:** By default, elements stack vertically in the order they appear in the DOM, but the z-index property allows us to change this behavior. 
  - **Example:** Stacking contexts are created by the root <html> element, when an element is positioned and given a z-index value other than auto, or when an element has an opacity of less than 1. Stacking contexts create a separate layer. The children inside each stacking context are ordered relative to their parent, before that layer is in turn arranged relative to any outer stacking contexts. 
  - **Source:** 
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context

- [x] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:** In the CSS rendering of a page, Block Formatting Context is a region in which blocks are laid out. New BFCs are created by floats, fixed or absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks, table-cells, elements with overflow other than visible, and elements with display: flow-root.  
  - **Use:** A BFC is like a mini-layout inside your page, and it's important because contains any floats inside it and prevents margin-collapsing. 
  - **Example:** For example, if you needed to contain a floated box inside a parent container, you could eatablish a new BFC by setting display: flow-root on the container. 
  - **Source:** https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/understanding-css-layout-block-formatting-context/
     - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context 
- [x] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:** One technique for clearing floats is the .clearfix hack. 
  - **Use:** The .clearfix hack works by inserting an element with no content just inside the closing tag of the parent container so that it can't collapse, and setting clear: both on this element.   
  
```css  
        .clearfix:after {
            content: "";
            display: table;
            clear: both;
        }
```
  - **Explanation:** Another technique is establishing a new block formatting context by setting overflow: auto or display: flow-root on the parent container. 
  - **Example:** I would go with .clearfix or display: flow-root in most contexts, as setting overflow: auto can lead to unintended scrollbars.

- [ ] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** CSS sprites are a way of combining multiple images into one image file, and then using the background-image and -position properties to display a part of the image each time. 
  - **Use:** They are used to increase performance, since you only need to download one image, rather than multiple images. 
  - **Example:** Image sprites are a great technique for small icons or a graphical text-editor menu.

- [x] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I have created grid layouts with floats, flexbox, and CSS grid. 
  - **Use:** I prefer using grid for the overall layout of the page, since it allows you to more precisely place elements along both axes. I like to use flexbox for building smaller components, which can in turn be positioned on the page using grid.

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time 😉)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
